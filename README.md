# pasteOCR - an Anki addon

This is an addon for the flashcard program Anki which allows you to paste images as text using optical character recognition (OCR).

It makes using screenshots of lecture slides or textbooks to make cards a breeze!

## Usage

Once installed, you will notice a button on the left.

If you have an image in your clipboard, say after taking a screenshot, clicking the button will extract text from the image and paste it. 

You can also use the keyboard shortcut for convenience: `Ctrl + Alt + V` on Windows or `Cmd + Alt + V` on Mac.

## Installation

pasteOCR uses the Tesseract OCR engine, a powerful OCR engine currently maintained by Google. More on Tesseract [here](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract).

If you are using Windows or Mac OSX, the Tesseract binaries are included with the addon.

For Linux, follow [the instructions here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) to install Tesseract.

Once Tesseract is ready to go, you can install the addon to Anki within the program, using the installation code: `1746010116`.
